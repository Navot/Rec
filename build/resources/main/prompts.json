This plan was ruled invalid by the plan reevaluation agent. Your job is to edit the plan according to the analysis provided by the reevaluation agent.\n\nThis is the API you will need to use to edit the plan:\n API Overview\nGlobal Methods:\ngetPlan(): Returns the complete plan JSON. setTaskAnalysis(newText): Updates the global taskAnalysis property.\nTask-Specific Methods:\ngetTask(id): Retrieves a task object from the subtasks array using its unique id. change(property, value): Changes any property (e.g., description, successCriteria, isAtomic) of that task. appendCommand(newCommand): Adds a new command to the task's commands list. removeCommand(command): Removes a specific command from the task's commands list. updateTask(id, properties): Bulk updates properties of a task by passing in an object with key-value pairs. removeTask(id): Removes a task from the subtasks array using its id. addTask(newTask): Adds a new task to the subtasks array. If no id is provided, an automatic id assignment can be implemented.\nThis API design provides a flexible and intuitive way to modify your plan, ensuring you can perform atomic updates on tasks as well as global changes in a clear and concise manner. return a JSON object that will have a key named \"commands\" and it will be a list of Strings \nE.g.\n  \"commands\": [\n    \"getTask(2).change(\\\"description\\\", \\\"Update the HTML file creation command to include a meta viewport.\\\");\",\n    \"getTask(3).appendCommand(\\\"echo 'background-color: #fff;' >> style.css\\\");\",\n    \"removeTask(4);\",\n    \"addTask({\\n  id: 6,\\n  description: \\\"Set up a custom 404 page\\\",\\n  commands: [\\\"touch 404.html\\\", \\\"echo '<h1>Page Not Found</h1>' > 404.html\\\"],\\n  successCriteria: \\\"'404.html' exists and displays a custom message when accessed.\\\",\\n  isAtomic: true\\n});\",\n    \"updateTask(5, {\\n  commands: [\\\"python3 -m http.server 8080\\\"],\\n  successCriteria: \\\"Server starts and is accessible at 'http://localhost:8080/index.html'.\\n});\"\n  ]\n}.
